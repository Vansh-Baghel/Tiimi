# Map in column
* When we map items from data file in react then use grid on it , ie , floating items in column then if the content of 1 column is bigger then it may not look even for another col of the table. 
* Items of 1 col would be up and another would be down and so on.

# Map in row
* If we use row toh heading is not properly alligned.
